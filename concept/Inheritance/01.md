# Virtual function  
- A virtual function is a function declared in a base class using the keyword `virtual` and is meant to be overridden in a derived class.
It allows runtime polymorphism, meaning the function that gets executed is determined at runtime based on the object type, not the pointer/reference type .
- In simple word it means that it allow the c++ to decide which version of the function it should use .

-`Override` means to replacce something with your own version .
- `Defination`-> function defination means the actual instrution which we write in code .
- `Declaration` -> Function declaration just tell the name .

# Pure Virtual Function 
- A pure virtual funtion is a virtual function in the c++ that has no defination in the base class and must be overriden in the derived class . In simple a function with no body,forces the derived class to write its own version .

# Abstract class 
- It is a class that has at least one pure virtual function and cannot create objects. It only provides a blueprint for derived classes . Means  It gives the idea/struture and the derived class complete it .



#  Normal class 
-  It is the regular class that can create object and contains complete defination of all it functions .
