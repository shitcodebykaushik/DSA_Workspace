# Structure 
- In C++ a structure is a user defined data types that allow you to group together varaible of different data types under a single name. Each variable inside the structure is refered to as 'member or field' .
# Declaration 
- The declaration itself does not allocated any memory ,It just tells the compiler what any struct will look like . We can not use the declaration to store data, It is necessary so the compiler know the structure layout before a variable of that type is created .
- To define the structure we use the keyword struct followed by the name of the structure name and a list of member varaible enclosed in curly braces .
 # Defination 
- It is the point where we assign the value to the struct varaible/member function .


# Accessing Structure Members 
- You can access the member of a structure using the dot(.) operator .



# Union 
- In c++ union is special class type that allows you to store differnt  data type in the same memory location but only one member can hold a value at any time . All member of the union share the same memory .
```c++
union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char c;
};

Data d;
d.i = 10;   // Now d.i holds 10
d.f = 3.14; // Now d.f holds 3.14, but d.i is overwritten
```
