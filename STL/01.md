Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of C++ template classes providing containers to store data (vectors, lists, maps) as well as algorithms to perform around them (searching, sorting).
Major advantages of using STL are reusability, efficiency, readability, and consistency in coding practices.
Moreover, you do not have to worry about the time and space complexity while using STL since it is already implemented in an optimal way.
# Vector 
- It is important to note that although vector provides insertion and deletion operations, both of these happen at the back of the vector in constant time. If we try to insert/delete at a random position that would take linear time.
- `s.begin() and s.end()` are iterators, not numbers.
