# Concurrency 
- The alternative approach to concurrency is to run multiple
Thread 1
threads in a single process.

# Output operation 
- If bytes flow from main memory to device like printer,display screen,or network connection etc,this is called as output operation .
- If bytes flow from device like printer,display or network connection etc,to main memory this is called as input operation .
- This cin is predefined object of istream class . It is connected with the standard input device ,which is usually keyboard .
- As we know that same name cant be give to multiple variables,function,classes etc, in the same scope. So to overcome this situtation namespace is introduced .
 # Data types
 - Data types are used to tell the varaible the type of the data they can store .
 - Wheneve a varaible is defined in C++ the complier allocates some memory for that variable based on the data type with which it is declated .
 - Every data type requires a different amount of memory .
 - There are these data types in the c++ 
   - Primary,built-in or fundamental data type .
    - Integer 
    - Character 
    - Boolean
    - Floating Point 
    - Double Floating Point 
    - Void 
    - Wide Character 

   # Derived data types 
   - Function 
   - Array 
   - Pointer 
   - Refernce 
   # User-defined data types
