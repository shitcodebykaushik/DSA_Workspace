# Important thing 
- `Parameterized Constructor` => A constructor that taked arguments .
- `Overloaded Constructor` Meanas having multiple constructor in one class .

- A poninter is the variable that stores the memory address of another variable . In the case of linked list each node contains .
  - `Data`-> The actual value stored in the node .
  - `Pointer` -> A pointer that stores the address of the next node in the list . This pointer is what allows the nodes to be connected forming a chain-like structure .
- Well the most important thing the `type of the pointer` and the class name must be the same in c++ becuse the pointer is specifically designed to store the memory address of an object of that class . The memory layout is core reason as the compiler need to know the structure of the object the pointers is pointing to in order to correctly access its members .

# Complete Search 
- Complete Search is general method that can be used to solve almost any algorithm problem . The idea is to generate all possible solution to the problem using the brute force and then select the best solution or count the number of solution , depending on the problem .
