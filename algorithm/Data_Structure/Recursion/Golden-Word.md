# The only one and rule we have here is 

- Process the first element,then recurse on the rest .
- Process the rest, then come back to the first element .

- `Pre-Order` => Root -> Left -> Right in this we visit the parent node before its children .
- `Post-Order` => `Left-Right->Root` In this we visit parent node after its children .
