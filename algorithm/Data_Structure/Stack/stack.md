# Stack 
- A stack is a non-primitive linear data structure . It is an ordered list in which the addition of a new data item and deletion of already existing data is done fron only one end known as the `top of the stack`(TOS) .

- The element which is added in the last will be the first to be removed and the element which is added in the first will be the removed in the last .

- The most frequently accessible element in the stack is the topmost element , whereas the least accessible element is the bottom of the stack . Push and Pop are two operation that are provided for the isertion and deletion from the top of the stack of the element . 

- The stack can be impelemented in two ways :- 
 -  Static implementation  -> Here array is used to create a stack . It is a simple technique but is not a flexible way of creation as the size of the stack has to be delcared during program design,after that size implementation is not efficient with respect to memory utilization .
 -  Dynamic implementation -> It is also called linked list representation and uses a pointer to implement the stack of data structure .

# The implementation of the array based Stack 
- Constructor initialization is impoertant
