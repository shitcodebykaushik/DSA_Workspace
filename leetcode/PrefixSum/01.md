# Theory 
- In most simple term we can say that prefix sum is the technique to calculate the sum at 'i' index in the array from the 
start of the array to the i th where we want to know the prefix sum .
- It reduce the time complexity for the calculating the sum queries .
- In prefix sum we have the base case to avoid the bug free code .
