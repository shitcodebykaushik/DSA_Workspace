# Singly Linked list 
A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure, it consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference to the next node in the linked list. The next of the last node is null, indicating the end of the list. Linked Lists support efficient insertion and deletion operations.
- Here all elements are not stored in the contiguous memory location. Instead each elements(called node) contains data part and a refernce(pointer) to the next node in the sequence .
- `No memory waste` Unlike arrays there is no need to pre-allocate fixed amount of memeory,reducing the chances of the memory waste .
- `Reverse traversal is difficult` Without previous pointer traversing backward is not straighforward .
- Insertion and Deletion at specific position is  fast here .
-`Head` A pointer that points to the first node of the linked list ,if the list is the empty the head pointer is `NUll` .
- `Tail node` The last node is known as the tail node .
